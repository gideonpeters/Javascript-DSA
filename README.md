<!-- How to pull from forked branch -->
- git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
- git fetch upstream

<!-- then: (like "git pull" which is fetch + merge) -->
- git merge upstream/master master

<!-- or, better, replay your local work on top of the fetched branch -->
<!-- like a "git pull --rebase" -->
- git rebase upstream/master
